                    I'm a PhD student at School of Computing, <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/">Dublin City University</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/">ADAPT Centre</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm under supervision of <a href="https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~gjones/">Prof. Gareth Jones</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research focuses on integration of multimodal signals into automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
                    spoken content retrieval (SCR). Every minute 300 hours of videos(!) are uploaded to YouTube.
                    We need a good retrieval system to find a video, that we are interested in, from a gigantic pile of videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SCR systems often rely on ASR transcription; hence improvement of ASR a key to better SCR.

                <h2>Understanding speech and language</h2>
                <p>
                    Why can one language vary in a so different way?<br>
                    I'm fascinated with chronological and geographical variation of language.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a list of videos about language I like.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h3>ASR for Scottish accent</h3>
                <p>
                    I like the Scottish accent so much.<br>
                    Unfortunately, I wasn't exposed to their accent much during my master's in Edinburgh :( <br>
                </p>
                <p>This is what would happen, when ASR cannot recognise the Scottish accent.</p>

                <h3>Ogasawara Creole</h3>
                <p>
                    I wasn't aware of this language, until my American friend sent me this clip.<br>
                    It's just the Japanese language, that includes so many English words and phrases,
                    so that it decided not to be Japanese.
                </p>

                <h3>Irish farmer accent</h3>
                <p>
                    This poor farmer got his sheep stolen.<br>
                    I know the background context of this video.<br>
                    Still, I have no clue what he is talking about.
