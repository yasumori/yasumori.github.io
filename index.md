# About Me
***
I'm Yasufumi Moriya, currently a PhD student at ADAPT Centre,
Dublin City University, Ireland. My research topics are **automatic speech
reocgnition** and **spoken document search**.

I worked on integration of visual and contextual information into automatic
speech recognition, automatic speech recognition for unconventional data
and speech document ranking models which can better handle errors of
automatic transcripts.
