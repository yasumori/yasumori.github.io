# About Me
***
I'm Yasufumi Moriya, Speech Scientist at T-Pro.

I completed my PhD at Dublin City University in 2022. My research topics included **automatic speech
reocgnition** and **spoken document search**.

I have worked on various things during my PhD such as:
<ul>
<li>Integration of visual and contextual information into automatic
speech recognition.</li>
<li>Automatic speech recognition for multi-domain data.</li>
<li>Speech document ranking models which can better handle errors of automatic transcripts.</li>
